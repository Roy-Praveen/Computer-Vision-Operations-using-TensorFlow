# Computer-Vision-Operations-using-TensorFlow
This repository contains scripts for computer vision tasks such as bounding box regression, object detection using APIs, instance segmentation and generation of saliency maps.\
Feel free to use them.\
Do check out other repos where I post my works on computer vision, data science and NLP.\
Cheers. :thumbsup:

## Object Detection using TensorFlow Object Detection API
ResNet is used as a default model and drone dataset is used.\
