# Computer-Vision-Operations-using-TensorFlow
This repository contains various computer vision operations which will be very useful.\
Python scripts contain various functions which are can be of great utility in computer vision tasks. These functions are used in the various notebooks also.\
The workflows implemented are,
1. Bounding box regression using transfer learning (python scripts).
2. Object detection with fine-tuned models from TensorFlow API (colab).
3. Instance segementation using TensorFlow (colab).
4. Visualization for debugging and enhancements (colab).\
Cheers. :thumbsup:
