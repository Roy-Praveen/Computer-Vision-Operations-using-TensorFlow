'''

Here the main objective of this script is to fine tune an existing
architecture from the Tensorflow Model Garden and finetune it to 
perform a custom object detection.

The process is simplified using TensorFlow object Detection API

Dataset: Any dataset with annotations of the expected format
Model: Default model used here is ResNet, but other models from model garden also be used
OS: Implementation was originally done in google colab but scripts can be used for other operating systems also

Recommended: Users are recommended to use a virtual environment to not affect other programs
